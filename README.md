# Infinite Scroll Is Not Enough

Infinite Scroll Is Not Eough (ISINE) is a web app built to satisfy the aching hunger one feels when they've scrolled a tad too far and found themselves in Davy Jones' Locker - or maybe just ran out of interesting tweets to read. Either way, this is the app for you!

- Tweets are generated using **GPT-2**
- Frontend built using **Gatsby, ReactJS, Sass, GraphQL** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**
- Backend built using **Flask and PostgreSQL** and hosting on **Heroku** 
- 3rd-part APIs include **Twitter's API** and **[InferKit]**
